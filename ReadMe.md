This is based on the Angular template created with 'dotnet new angular'
It uses ASP.NET Core 2 and Angular 7
It also uses an SSL certificate for secure connection

Instructions how to create the certificate are here

Warning: 
OmniSharp in VS Code was giving errors as described here:
https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2965
Replace: sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.2 
With: sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.2=2.2.105-1
Do not update if prompted by the OS, until this is resolved!

Finally,I just love to see the green padlock and the message "Connection is secure"
